This project was created [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It contains a set of features designed to improve the collaboration between field-based teams and their managers.

# Features
## Location Feed
Non-manager users are able to check in and out of a set number of locations. As users check-in and out of locations, the location feed updates. All users have access to the location feed and can see where their teammates have recently checked into.

## Safety Concerns
Users are able to log safety concerns. This sends their current latitude and longitude to their manager. The manager is able to see where the user is on a Google map. Managers can then resolve a safety concern. 

## Announcement Feed
Managers can add and delete announcements for their team's announcement feed. The feed is visible to all users, who can also comment on and like announcements.

# Testing
This is a WIP
